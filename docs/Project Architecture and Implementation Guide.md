# Project Architecture and Implementation Guide

## Overview

The `ds-practice-2024` project simulates a distributed system for an online bookstore. It features a frontend service, an orchestrator service, and three backend microservices: fraud detection, transaction verification, and suggestions. The system employs REST for frontend-backend communication and gRPC for inter-service communication. A significant feature of this system is its use of a priority queue in the order processing mechanism, allowing for more sophisticated order handling based on defined criteria.

## Architecture

### Components

- **Frontend Service**: Interacts with users, collecting order requests and displaying order statuses and book suggestions.
- **Orchestrator Service**: Serves as the central hub for processing requests from the frontend. It communicates with backend services and consolidates results.
- **Fraud Detection Service**: Analyzes transactions to identify potential fraud.
- **Transaction Verification Service**: Confirms the validity of transactions.
- **Suggestions Service**: Provides book recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Order Queue Service**: Manages order processing using a priority queue, ensuring that orders are processed based on priority criteria.
- **Order Executor Service**: Responsible for executing orders. It includes a leader election mechanism to ensure that only the elected leader can dequeue and execute orders.

### Communication

- **REST API**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and the orchestrator.
- **gRPC**: Enables communication between the orchestrator and backend services, as well as within backend services themselves.

## Implementation Tasks

### REST Implementation

- Implement REST API endpoints in the orchestrator service as per the OpenAPI specification in `utils/api/bookstore.yaml`.

### Orchestrator Service

- Implement logic to deploy worker threads for parallel processing of requests to backend services using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

### Backend Microservices

- Implement dummy logic for fraud detection on port 50051.
- Implement simple logic for transaction verification on port 50052.
- Implement logic for returning book suggestions on port 50053.

### gRPC Communication Setup

- Establish gRPC channels in the orchestrator to communicate with backend services.
- Define gRPC services and messages based on `.proto` files in `utils/pb`.

### Priority Queue in Order Processing

- Modify the Order Queue Service to use a priority queue for managing orders. Orders are prioritized based on criteria such as the number of books in an order, with orders containing more books given higher priority.
- Use Python's `heapq` module to implement the priority queue functionality.
- Ensure thread safety when enqueuing and dequeuing orders by using locks.

### Leader Election in Order Executor Service

- Implement a leader election mechanism in the Order Executor Service to ensure that only the elected leader can dequeue and execute orders.
- After executing an order, trigger a re-election to allow for dynamic leadership.

### System Logging

- Implement logging across services to capture key events such as request reception, thread spawning, and response sending.

## Docker and Docker Compose

- Containerize each service using Docker, with configurations specified in `docker-compose.yaml`.
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the services, ensuring they are networked together for communication.

## Updated Service Descriptions

### Payment Service
The Payment Service is responsible for handling financial transactions within the system. It operates on port 50056 and uses gRPC for communication.

#### Key Features:
- **Transaction Management**: Supports operations to prepare, commit, and abort financial transactions.
- **Concurrency Control**: Uses locks to ensure thread-safe operations on financial resources.
- **State Recovery**: Capable of recovering its state from a log file to maintain consistency even after restarts.

#### Operations:
- **Prepare**: Reserves funds for a transaction.
- **Commit**: Finalizes the transaction and processes the payment.
- **Abort**: Rolls back the transaction and releases the reserved funds.

### Book Database Service
The Book Database Service manages the storage and retrieval of book data. It includes a Raft consensus mechanism for distributed consensus and operates on port 50051.

#### Key Features:
- **Distributed Consensus**: Implements the Raft algorithm to ensure consistency across multiple nodes.
- **Direct Socket Communication**: Handles direct client connections for data operations.
- **State Recovery**: Recovers its state from a log file to ensure data consistency.

#### Operations:
- **Read**: Retrieves book data based on a key.
- **Write**: Updates or adds new book data.
- **IncrementStock**: Increases the stock count for a book.
- **DecrementStock**: Decreases the stock count for a book if sufficient stock is available.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and implementation steps for the `ds-practice-2024` project. It highlights the system's use of REST and gRPC for communication, the implementation of a priority queue for order processing, and the dynamic leader election mechanism in the Order Executor Service.
